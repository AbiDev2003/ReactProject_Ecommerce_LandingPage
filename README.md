### Component Flow Explanation
- **App.jsx** is the root component (purple box)
- **Header & Footer** (green boxes) are always visible across all pages
- **Conditional Rendering** (orange diamond) switches between different pages based on navbar selection
- **Dashboard.jsx** (blue box) is the most complex page with 3 child components
- **UserDetailCardSection.jsx** further imports **UserDetails.jsx**
